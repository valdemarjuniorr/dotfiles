Lazyssh is a terminal-based, interactive SSH manager inspired by tools like lazydocker and k9s — but built for managing your fleet of servers directly from your terminal.
<br/>
With lazyssh, you can quickly navigate, connect, manage, and transfer files between your local machine and any server defined in your `~/.ssh/config`. No more remembering IP addresses or running long scp commands — just a clean, keyboard-driven UI.

## ✨ Features

### Server Management
- 📜 Read & display servers from your `~/.ssh/config` in a scrollable list.
- ➕ Add a new server from the UI by specifying alias, host/IP, username, port, identity file.
- ✏ Edit existing server entries directly from the UI.
- 🗑 Delete server entries safely.
- 📌 Pin / unpin servers to keep favorites at the top.
- 🏓 Ping server to check status.

### Quick Server Navigation
- 🔍 Fuzzy search by alias, IP, or tags.
- 🖥 One‑keypress SSH into the selected server (Enter).
- 🏷 Tag servers (e.g., prod, dev, test) for quick filtering.
- ↕️ Sort by alias or last SSH (toggle + reverse).


### Upcoming
- 📁 Copy files between local and servers with an easy picker UI.
- 📡 Port forwarding (local↔remote) from the UI.
- 🔑 Enhanced Key Management:
    - Use default local public key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` or `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`)
    - Paste custom public keys manually
    - Generate new keypairs and deploy them
    - Automatically append keys to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` with correct permissions

## 🔐 Security Notice

lazyssh does not introduce any new security risks.
It is simply a UI/TUI wrapper around your existing `~/.ssh/config` file.

- All SSH connections are executed through your system’s native ssh binary (OpenSSH).

- Private keys, passwords, and credentials are never stored, transmitted, or modified by lazyssh.

- Your existing IdentityFile paths and ssh-agent integrations work exactly as before.

- lazyssh only reads and updates your `~/.ssh/config`. A backup of the file is created automatically before any changes.

- File permissions on your SSH config are preserved to ensure security.
